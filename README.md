# base-box-cookbook

---
## Purpose:

 - SSH server configuration
 - admin user creation (add your own public key for non-vagrant access)

---
## Usage

### Pre-Requisites
 - VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
 - Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/)
 - Chef Development Kit (chefdk): https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/
  - the Chef Development Kit includes a number of useful dependancies (but see below)

### A note about Chef Dev Kit and other development tools
 - DO NOT install rbenv, it will directly conflict with chefdk
   - https://github.com/chef/chef-dk/issues/16
 - personally, on Linux I've highly restricted the chefdk path, since I want to be able to do non-chef ruby development, although this is subtly imperfect, and possibly breaking:

```
export PATH="$/opt/chefdk/bin:$PATH"
export PATH=$PATH:~/packer/
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

### Development
```sh
bundle install
kitchen converge
```

### Currently tested with Chef 13 on
 - centos-7.3
 - ubuntu-16.04
